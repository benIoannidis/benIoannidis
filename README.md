- Welcome, I’m @benIoannidis
- I am a game developer and currently studying at AIE.

- Over the past year I have learnt everything from the basics of game mathematics, 
  to AI state machines, as well as physics, and rendering and shaders.
  
- I am looking forward to getting my start in the growing game development industry in Australia.
