- Welcome, I’m @benIoannidis
- I am a game developer based in Melbourne, Australia.

- I have had the pleasure of working with everything from the basics of game mathematics, 
  to AI state machines, as well as physics, and rendering and shaders.
  
- I am looking forward to getting my start in the growing game development industry in Australia.
